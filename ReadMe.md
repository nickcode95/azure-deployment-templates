In this repo you'll find a collection of Microsoft Azure deployments templates for both Azure Resource Manager with JSON as well as Azure Bicep; the new syntax encouraged from Microsoft

The templates have been organised by deployment type such as compute, networking etc

Some good news is you can export your current Azure Resource Manager templates into Bicep via this VSCode extension:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/quickstart-create-bicep-use-visual-studio-code?tabs=CLI

It will re-compile your ARM template into Bicep
